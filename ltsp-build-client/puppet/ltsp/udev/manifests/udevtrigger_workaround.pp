  # XXX The default /etc/init/udevtrigger.conf does not always do its
  # job properly, probably because some of the rule files have been
  # changed or created after udevd has started and becuase inotify does
  # not seem to work properly with overlayfs [1].
  #
  # Symptoms include:
  #   - /dev/fuse has invalid permissions
  #   - Mimio usb device node has invalid permissions
  #
  # Telling udevd to reload rules (/sbin/udevadm control --reload-rules)
  # before triggering buffered kernel events seems to fix the issue.
  #
  # There are also problems with generated udev rules. Again, my guess
  # is that there are problems with inotify+overlayfs -combo: udevd does
  # not realize that generator-rules have generated new rule files and
  # therefore does not use them. The fix is simple: tell udevd to reload
  # rules after writing has finished by calling
  #   /sbin/udevadm control --reload-rules
  # before exit in /lib/udev/write_(net|cd)_rules scripts.
