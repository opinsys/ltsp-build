# For more information about valid options please see:
# /usr/share/doc/ltsp-client/examples/lts-parameters.txt.gz
# in the client environment.

# Note that things like sound and local device support are
# auto-enabled if the corresponding packages are installed,
# there is no need to manually set these options anymore.
#
# **** THIS FILE SHOULD NO LONGER BE USED FROM HERE !!! ****
#
# With the introduction of the nbd/unionfs/squashfs structure
# the lts.conf file moved to the tftp root please create:
# /var/lib/tftpboot/ltsp/i386/lts.conf instead for your changes
#
# In case you want to use the lts.conf here, this still works,
# but you need to run ltsp-update-image after every change.
